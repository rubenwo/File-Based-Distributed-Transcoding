DISCONTINUED!

APLHA release is functional, but has a lot of bugs. I'll be developing a Chunk-Based Distributed Encoder since that has better inherent scalability. 

      File-Based Distributed Transcoding (This program uses static-ffmpeg releases)

      1: Start the application
      2: Start a server
      3: Start a Master Node
      4: Start at least 1 slave/encoder Node

      5: Open a directory you want to transcode (under file in the menu bar).
      6: Configure encoder settings (Optional load a preset, under file in the menu bar)
      7: Click "Start Encoding" to distribute and start encoding your selected files.
